# Python-Predict-ML

In this project I will be creating a machine learning algorithm to predict the outcome of NBA games. The project will provide a winning probability of each game on a given day. The program will utilize the NBA API at https://github.com/swar/nba_api to load, clean and process the data on various games in the past. I had originally decided to webscrape the data from nba websites online but decided the methods within this API are very useful and it would be easier to manage large quantities of data using this API instead.

Next Steps:
1. The NBA has an upset rate of ~32% this means that if my model accuracy is below 68% (preferrably higher that 75%) it will not be accounting for the upsets that happen, try to find a way to figure out if an upset will happen.

2. Transform the entire project into an object oriented program .
